        <h1>About me: </h1>

        <p>
            I'm João Pedro Kieuteka, a guy raised and born in Curitiba-Paraná Brazil, I've started to studying a little bit of Software development lately and I did this little page to exercise my knowledges in HTML and CSS, I also did some coding in C programming language, which was the first language i had contact with.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can check all the stuff I did in Development (including this page) on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JoaoKieuteka">github profile</a>, it's pretty bare for now but I promise I will add a lot more stuf in the near future, so stay tuned for that :D
        </p>

        <p>
            I also like gaming (Probably a little too much) and music, I literally listen to whatever genre I'm interested in that moment, but my Favorite genres are: Jazz, Hip-Hop and Heavy-Metal (They are EXTREMELLY different from each other LOL), I even produce some music sometimes, so if you are interest in listening to some Lo-Fi Hip-Hop and Ambient beats I got you covered: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-pt/artist/5kNeBZumP1pAzs6B9XGbvl" target="_blank">My music stuff</a>
